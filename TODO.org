** Workers for crons
*** Some ideas about sanity checking transcodings broken, or not done totaly etc.

** Tags for tracks
** FTS Search for sounds

** Some basic statistics of files
*** Played from player, downloads (transcode, orig)

* Album: switch song duration stay empty lot of times

***Low priority:
** SQL optimization
** translations check
** Make a waveform display for tracks list (not track view or album view) better than the ugly one with grey background

~~~~~~~~~ ACTIVITYPUB ~~~~~~~~
-> profile UPDATE not handled yet (littleboxes don't handle UPDATE) upstream

~~~~~~~~~ VARIOUS ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only show to public processed songs
Also do not show player until processing is done, and waveform done

X-Accel-Redirect have not been implemented again
    not sure it would be useful ?

Check for sentry in:
 - waitress (web)
 - celery (workers)

Slugs : BEFORE, and UNIQUE; Some things weird on that side IIRC
Emails notifications (register, password changed, track ready)
Album selector in new upload -> Add first element empty "No album"

Celery things to add in web interface:
  - log user
    - jobs failed
    - retry
  - admin interface
    - jobs failed
    - retry
