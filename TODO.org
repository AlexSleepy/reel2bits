* GLOBAL

** Workers for crons
*** Some ideas about sanity checking transcodings broken, or not done totaly etc.

** Tags for tracks
** Search

** Some basic statistics of files
*** Played from player, downloads (transcode, orig)

* Album: switch song duration stay empty lot of times

***Low priority:
** SQL optimization
** translations check
** Make a waveform display for tracks list (not track view or album view) better than the ugly one with grey background

~~~~~~~~~ ACTIVITYPUB ~~~~~~~~
-> profile UPDATE not handled yet (littleboxes don't handle UPDATE)
-> no webfinger in DEV env because no handling in littleboxes
--> Issues opened for both

~~~~~~~~~ VARIOUS ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only show to public processed songs
Also do not show player until processing is done, and waveform done

If waveform error, do not publicize the song and show banner error for uploader

Check for sentry in:
 - waitress (web)
 - celery (workers)

Slugs : BEFORE, and UNIQUE; Some things weird on that side IIRC
Emails notifications (register, password changed, track ready)
Album selector in new upload -> Add first element empty "No album"
Permit "hiding" download links ? (mostly useless because player needs one at some point...)

Celery things to add in web interface:
  - log user
    - jobs failed
    - retry
  - admin interface
    - jobs failed
    - retry
